This is the solution code from the 'Robi Axiata Datathon 2019' problem set of from `EASY` category `No. 02` 

## Brainstorming

Please follow this [Wiki section](https://github.com/rafatrock/axiata-robi-datathon-19-easy-02/wiki) to get an idea on how I strategise my initiatives to reach the common goal.

## Prerequisites

To run the desired operations you need to install all the dependencies. Since this is a competion where we need to deal with gigagntic amount of data, the best approach is to prepare ourselved first to handle that data and then start implementing the code. [In this tutorial](https://github.com/rafatrock/bigdata-prepare-python) I already discussed different strategies on how to deal with Big Data. Please follow the steps so that you can ready to conduct the massive computational operations.

## Deployment

You can either upload the `.py` file or `.ipynb` file in the cloud environment and run the script to get the desired outcome.

## Execution

To plan and execute the desired operations and Python codes I utilised Jupyter Notebook to make this journey interactive. Please follow this [Notebook](https://github.com/rafatrock/axiata-robi-datathon-19-easy-01/blob/master/robi_datathon_19_easy_02.ipynb) file to see how the operations been performed and their outputs.

```

## Output

The output is a table with two column to display the desired outcomes.
